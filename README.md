SaveMyDate
==========
SaveMyDate! is a (for now) webapp that helps people entertain people who are important to them, whether they be partner or business manager.
SaveMyDate! lets the user search in at least one of three ways.
They can enter the Facebook name into a search bar and use Facebook's dropdown menu to select the right person. SaveMyDate will then return their listed interests. The user chooses one, and it is run through the second engine.
The second engine searches for specific interests. These are run through the open data (which will hopefullly always be expanding) we have available. The user will click a specific map location within a (user-defined) 1-20 km radius from a (user-defined location) and it will be run through the fourth engine.
The third engine involves the user already knowing where they want to go and inputting a specific location. This will be run through the fourth engine.
The fourth engine is an output engine that returns all information SaveMyDate! has about a location (restaurant reviews and ratings, etc.), as well as an hour-by-hour weather forecast for the next week.
